# Create a shiny app summarising your phenotyping results

A shiny app that is designed for any diagnostics results from
phenotypeR, this includes:

- A diagnostics on the database via `databaseDiagnostics`.

- A diagnostics on the cohort_codelist attribute of the cohort via
  `codelistDiagnostics`.

- A diagnostics on the cohort via `cohortDiagnostics`.

- A diagnostics on the population via `populationDiagnostics`.

- A diagnostics on the matched cohort via `matchedDiagnostics`.

## Usage

``` r
shinyDiagnostics(
  result,
  directory,
  minCellCount = 5,
  open = rlang::is_interactive(),
  expectationsDir = NULL,
  clinicalDescriptionsDir = NULL,
  databaseDescriptionsDir = NULL,
  removeEmptyTabs = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- result:

  A summarised result

- directory:

  Directory where to save report

- minCellCount:

  Minimum cell count for suppression when exporting results.

- open:

  If TRUE, the shiny app will be launched in a new session. If FALSE,
  the shiny app will be created but not launched.

- expectationsDir:

  Directory where to find the expectations CSV.

- clinicalDescriptionsDir:

  Directory where to find the clinical descriptions word documents.

- databaseDescriptionsDir:

  Directory where to find the database descriptions word documents.

- removeEmptyTabs:

  Whether to remove tabs of those diagnostics that have not been
  performed or that were insufficient counts to produce a result (TRUE)
  or not (FALSE)

## Value

A shiny app
