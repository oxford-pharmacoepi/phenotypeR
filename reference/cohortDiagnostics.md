# Run cohort-level diagnostics

Runs phenotypeR diagnostics on the cohort. The diganostics include:

- Age groups and sex summarised.

- A summary of visits of everyone in the cohort using visit_occurrence
  table.

- A summary of age and sex density of the cohort.

- Attrition of the cohorts.

- Overlap between cohorts (if more than one cohort is being used).

## Usage

``` r
cohortDiagnostics(
  cohort,
  cohortId = NULL,
  cohortCount = TRUE,
  cohortCharacteristics = TRUE,
  largeScaleCharacteristics = TRUE,
  compareCohorts = FALSE,
  cohortSurvival = FALSE,
  cohortSample = 20000,
  matchedSample = 1000
)
```

## Arguments

- cohort:

  Cohort table in a cdm reference

- cohortId:

  Specific cohort definition ID for which to run cohort diagnostics.

- cohortCount:

  Whether to run
  [`CohortCharacteristics::summariseCohortCount()`](https://darwin-eu.github.io/CohortCharacteristics/reference/summariseCohortCount.html)
  and
  [`CohortCharacteristics::summariseCohortAttrition()`](https://darwin-eu.github.io/CohortCharacteristics/reference/summariseCohortAttrition.html)
  (TRUE) or not (FALSE).

- cohortCharacteristics:

  Whether to run
  [`CohortCharacteristics::summariseCharacteristics()`](https://darwin-eu.github.io/CohortCharacteristics/reference/summariseCharacteristics.html)
  and summarise age density (TRUE) or not (FALSE).

- largeScaleCharacteristics:

  Whether to run
  [`CohortCharacteristics::summariseLargeScaleCharacteristics()`](https://darwin-eu.github.io/CohortCharacteristics/reference/summariseLargeScaleCharacteristics.html)
  (TRUE) or not (FALSE).

- compareCohorts:

  Whether to run
  [`CohortCharacteristics::summariseCohortOverlap()`](https://darwin-eu.github.io/CohortCharacteristics/reference/summariseCohortOverlap.html)
  and
  [`CohortCharacteristics::summariseCohortTiming()`](https://darwin-eu.github.io/CohortCharacteristics/reference/summariseCohortTiming.html)
  (TRUE) or not (FALSE). Notice that, if set to TRUE, the diagnostics
  will only be run when there are more than one cohort.

- cohortSurvival:

  Whether to run
  [`CohortSurvival::estimateSingleEventSurvival()`](https://darwin-eu.github.io/CohortSurvival/reference/estimateSingleEventSurvival.html)
  (TRUE) or not (FALSE).

- cohortSample:

  The number of people to take a random sample for cohortDiagnostics. If
  `cohortSample = NULL`, no sampling will be performed.

- matchedSample:

  The number of people to take a random sample for matching. If
  `matchedSample = NULL`, no sampling will be performed. If
  `matchedSample = 0`, no matched cohorts will be created.

## Value

A summarised result
