# Database diagnostics

PhenotypeR diagnostics on the cdm object.

Diagnostics include:

- Summarise a cdm_reference object, creating a snapshot with the
  metadata of the cdm_reference object

- Summarise the observation period table getting some overall statistics
  in a summarised_result object.

- Summarise the person table including demographics (sex, race,
  ethnicity, year of birth) and related statistics.

- Summarise the OMOP clinical tables where the codes associated with
  your cohort are found.

## Usage

``` r
databaseDiagnostics(
  cohort,
  cohortId = NULL,
  snapshot = TRUE,
  personTableSummary = TRUE,
  observationPeriodsSummary = TRUE,
  clinicalRecordsSummary = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- cohort:

  Cohort table in a cdm reference

- cohortId:

  Specific cohort definition ID for which to run database diagnostics.
  This will only affect the clinical tables summary results.

- snapshot:

  Whether to run
  [`OmopSketch::summariseOmopSnapshot()`](https://OHDSI.github.io/OmopSketch/reference/summariseOmopSnapshot.html)
  (TRUE) or not (FALSE).

- personTableSummary:

  Whether to run
  [`OmopSketch::summarisePerson()`](https://OHDSI.github.io/OmopSketch/reference/summarisePerson.html)
  (TRUE) or not (FALSE).

- observationPeriodsSummary:

  Whether to run
  [`OmopSketch::summariseObservationPeriod()`](https://OHDSI.github.io/OmopSketch/reference/summariseObservationPeriod.html)
  (TRUE) or not (FALSE).

- clinicalRecordsSummary:

  Whether to run
  [`OmopSketch::summariseClinicalRecords()`](https://OHDSI.github.io/OmopSketch/reference/summariseClinicalRecords.html)
  on those clinical tables where the codes associated with your cohort
  are found (TRUE) or not (FALSE).

## Value

A summarised result
