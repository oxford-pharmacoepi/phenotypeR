# Phenotype a cohort

This comprises all the diagnostics that are being offered in this
package, this includes:

- A diagnostic on the OMOP CDM dataset as a whole via
  `databaseDiagnostics`.

- A diagnostic on the codelists associated with cohorts via
  `codelistDiagnostics`.

- A diagnostic on the cohort itself via `cohortDiagnostics`.

- A diagnostic on the frequency of the cohort in the dataset population
  via `populationDiagnostics`.

## Usage

``` r
phenotypeDiagnostics(
  cohort,
  databaseDiagnostics = list(),
  codelistDiagnostics = list(),
  cohortDiagnostics = list(),
  populationDiagnostics = list(),
  stagingDirectory = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- cohort:

  Cohort table in a cdm reference

- databaseDiagnostics:

  A list of arguments that uses `databaseDiagnostics`. If the list is
  empty, the default values will be used. Example: In the following
  example, all diagnostics will be run except *person table summary*
  from databaseDiagnostics: \*databaseDiagnostics = list(
  "personTableSummary" = FALSE )

- codelistDiagnostics:

  A list of arguments that uses `codelistDiagnostics`. If the list is
  empty, the default values will be used. Example: In the below example,
  all diagnostics will be run, and a subsample of 1,000 participants
  will be used to run measurement diagnostics and another independent
  subsample of 500 participants will be used to run drug diagnostics:
  \*codelistDiagnostics = list( "measurementDiagnosticsSample" = 1000,
  "drugDiagnosticsSample" = 500 )

- cohortDiagnostics:

  A list of arguments that uses `cohortDiagnostics`. If the list is
  empty, the default values will be used. Example: \*cohortDiagnostics =
  list( "cohortSurvival" = TRUE )

- populationDiagnostics:

  A list of arguments that uses `populationDiagnostics`. If the list is
  empty, the default values will be used. Example: In the below example,
  all diagnostics will be run and a subsample of 100,000 participants
  will be used to run populationDiagnostics. \*populationDiagnostics =
  list( "populationSample" = 100000 )

- stagingDirectory:

  Path to folder to save incremental results and log file

## Value

A summarised result
